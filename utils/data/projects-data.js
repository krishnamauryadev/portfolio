    description:
      "Magento 2 Performance Enhancement through React IntegrationIn a separate Magento project, I addressed performance issues in specific areas by integrating React and React DOM without altering the core Magento 2 structure. This innovative approach involved creating a custom module that replaced Knockout.js with React, utilizing Babel for JavaScript transpilation and Webpack for module bundling. By implementing React in targeted sections of the site, I significantly enhanced load times and improved the user experience while maintaining Magento's core functionality. This solution not only optimized performance but also showcased my ability to leverage modern frontend technologies within established eCommerce platforms.",
